For getting things done.

## Progress

Issue creation works, db is being populated. 
The way that html is being returned by the endpoints is not functioning as expected.
Unable to consistently list what is in the DB by rendering the issue-list.
Probably using htmx improperly.
Will need to split out api method handling from the models.

## Stack

- Go/Fiber
- HTMX
- Sqlite
- PicoCSS

## Future Considerations

- Unocss instead of picocss
- Marmot for sqlite replication (eventually consistent)
